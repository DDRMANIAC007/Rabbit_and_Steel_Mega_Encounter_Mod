# Rabbit &amp; Steel Mega Encounter Mod

A mod for Rabbit &amp; Steel that combines multiple encounter mods into one single mod. The game does not currently support using more than one encounter mod at a time which gave me the idea for this mod. The encounters are sprinkled throughout the various zones where they make sense with their chances being guaranteed. Some of the bosses only have Lunar versions so be warned if playing on lower difficulties! Also mods may not support singleplayer!

All areas past the starting area have 1 additional loot sphere. Pale keep has 3 additional loot spheres! This mod is VERY difficult to beat on Lunar difficulty! (Potentially the hardest on the entire workshop as of the current time)

This version of the mod includes any custom sprites used by the mods. This requires all players to have the mod otherwise they will see a placeholder instead of custom sprites. 
You can find the vanilla version of the mod here:
