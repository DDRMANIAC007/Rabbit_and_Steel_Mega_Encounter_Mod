# Rabbit &amp; Steel Mega Encounter Mod
A mod for Rabbit &amp; Steel that combines multiple encounter mods into one single mod. The game does not currently support using more than one encounter mod at a time which gave me the idea for this mod. The encounters are sprinkled throughout the various zones where they make sense with their chances being guaranteed. Some of the bosses only have Lunar versions so be warned if playing on lower difficulties! Also mods may not support singleplayer!

This version of the mod replaces any custom sprites with sprites from the vanilla game. This allows players without the mod to see a boss sprite.
You can find the regular version of the mod here:
